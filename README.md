AutoCAD Javascript API, Fixes, Autodesk.AutoCAD.js

This is a slightly updated version of the V2 Autodesk.AutoCAD.js file provided by AutoDesk via http://www.autocadws.com/jsapi/v2/Autodesk.AutoCAD.js 

Their old one wasn't working with any examples anymore.

To run any example you need to download and modify the LoadIntoAutoCAD.js file and change the html file path string to your local html file to load.  Then you'll want to webload the LoadIntoAutoCAD.js file.
